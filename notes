- halt on 503 - downtime

docker compose down -v

halt when api is down and only ping every x seconds

when a worker dies, clean out the url in the data base


x-esi-error-limit-remain = how many fails you have left in the time frame set by reset
and
x-esi-error-limit-reset = how many seconds until the remain is reset to max value

The error limit is global for all endpoints.

Once remain hit zero, you will get the 420. So, once remain hit zero (or get close to the limit - if you have multiple requests in flight), you need to stop all requests for reset seconds.
